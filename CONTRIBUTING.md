# Contributing

If you contribute code that you have written yourself, then it must be contributed under the same license as the
PortletMVC4Spring project, specifically the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

If you contribute code that you have not written yourself (i.e. copied from elsewhere), then the original license that
governs the contribution must be kept in place. The original license must be clearly referenced in the contribution and
must be compatible with the Apache License, Version 2.0.

##  Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Contributions must be received in the form of GitHub pull requests and must adhere to the requirements of the
[DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)] by adding a "Signed-off-by" line to commit messages.

For example:

	This is my contribution that implements feature XYZ.

	Signed-off-by: Developer Name <developer@mycompany.com>

Note that Git as has a convenient `-s` command line option that will automatically append the "Signed-off-by" line to
a commit message:

	$ git commit -s -m 'This is my contribution that implements feature XYZ.'

Pull requests that do not contain the "Signed-off-by" line in commit messages will have their status automatically
set to 'failed' by the [GitHub DCO Application](https://github.com/apps/dco).
